			Model - How the application behaves with data.
			View - Whatever is visible to the user.
			Controller - The coding which would act between model and view. It basically acts as the link between the model and the view.
			Model <- Controller -> View. The model and view are isolated from each other. The logic of application is completely separated from the user interaction.
